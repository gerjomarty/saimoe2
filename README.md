Saimoe
======

This app is a Ruby on Rails 3.2 app in progress to document/analyse proceedings from the annual [2ch][1] [Anime Saimoe Tournament][2]\. Data is taken from the [unofficial English language Saimoe site][3]\.

\(It's much the same as [gerjomarty/saimoe][4], but built with Twitter Bootstrap and with tests\.\)
